### 🛠️ Tools / Commands Used
`ls` , `cat`

### 🧭 Approach
- Initially I tried to find any files in the directory using the ls command
- I found the - file (A special character file! hmm... seems interesting!)
- I used the `cat` command to see it's contents but got an error.
- Searching the google seemed to help by going through good old stackOverflow docs
- Seems like there is a special way of reading these files i.e. `cat < -`
- Inside was the password!
